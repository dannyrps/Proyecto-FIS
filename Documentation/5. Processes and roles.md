# **Methodology**
The methodology used for our "Information system" project we'll be focus on ***scrum***, because this agile methodology gives us different tools that'll help us have a better organization of the project, allowing us to finish on time the majority of the tasks according to the previously established requirements. 

# Roles 
Taking in count the *scrum* methodology the team was divided in the following different teams:

- Ehuan Avila Isaac Mauricio = *Scrum Master / Develop Team* 
- Baas Cab Jorge Miguel = *Product Owner*
- Couoh Chan Maria Belen = *Develop Team*
- Perera Huchim Oscar = *Develop Team*
- PÃ©rez Sauza Daniela Regina = *Develop Team*

# Tasks
Each team member will have assigned tasks that must be fulfilled in the established time, this tasks are be from the *Product Backlog* based on the user stories that were definied during the requirements stage. 

Each task has a different type of complexity and are prioritize by levels, this way each members tasks will be balanced.

On the other hand, the Trello app will be used to have a better control of the tasks and acitivities.

(see *Product Backlog*)

# Sprint
In the course of the software building development a series of sprints will be made which will help us solve a big deal of necessities in a short period of time. We've decided on having 3 sprints; the first will be the interface, the second one will be about the organizations and lastly the third will be about the careers offered in the math faculty, each one will have a span of 2 to 3 weeks, this will not be delay from the established time because it could be perjudicial in the future, this because we have a small period of time for us to complete, improve and perfect the tasks already described.

###### Sprint planning
For a better result to each sprint we'll plan ahead so we can have the best outcome, where we'll define all the needed tasks that have to be accomplished so we can achieve our goal.

###### Daily Scrum
While we're working daily meetings will be done of about 20 or 30 minutes for the purpose of airing out doubts or problems that the members have encountered, it will also be to talk about the daily progress of each member and above all we'll compare the over all progress with the established time. This as part of our quality control process.

###### Submission
For this project to be submitted it will be required to verify if it satifies each an every one of our requirements and conditions that had already been told, and especially that our Product Owner validates our product with his already established necessities.

###### Sprint review
This one being the final stage of each sprint, is done for the team to meet and talk about the work done, how con each member improve, what techniques and methods can be implemented to the next sprint so that the process can be more agile. This feedback is part of the revising process where de quality control takes place, being that each sprint has certain specifications that need to be fulfilled.




# Scheduling

* The dates established in the calendar may vary throughout the development of the project.

# First submission reflexion

*(How much did our process followed the scrum methodology? Why? What would you have changed?)*
 
We felt that we needed more communication, it could be compare to the daily scrum; being that, when we found any difficulty we ended up carrying it with us until the very end of the first submission. For example, when we were sending emails to teachers and coordinators there was no response, this because the mails lacked presentation and formality; thanks to our absence of communication and meetings to discuss our problems, we didn't realize a common difficulty and thus we couldn't solve it in time. Similarly, at the beginning we didn't had a clear idea of the agile methodology and ended up doing extra work, like making the requirements even though we already had user stories; also, making more complex certain activities like the contribution metrics or the use case diagram. In conclusion, we think that what we would have is: having more meetings and doing a more exhaustive research from the beginning about the methodology that we're using so we didn't do any extra work nor making more complex any activities.
