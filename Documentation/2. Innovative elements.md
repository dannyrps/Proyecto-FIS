# Innovative elements:

 1. The element that makes this project innovative is the way the careers are presented, being that it will be a simpler and more dynamic way, not using any technical concepts and being as brief as possible.

  2. Another element to take in count is that all the main faculty organizations will be shown, capturing even more the atention of the user.

  3. This product is a necessity in a way, since most of the people interested do not have a clear idea about the career they are getting into, and therefore, this project is an original way to inform and also capture the atention of the new students so they can see the organizations they can go to, and all the help they can get.
